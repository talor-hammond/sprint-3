# What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works? #

When the layout is resized less than 550px, the size of the content on the screen changes dynamically through the use of percentage-based widths; eventually "collapsing" on itself with the use of CSS applied according to certain "media-queries".
